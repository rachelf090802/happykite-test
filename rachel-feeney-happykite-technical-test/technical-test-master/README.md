# Happy Technical Test

This is a small guide to the technical test but if you have any issues feel free to contact us at [phil@happykite.co.uk](mailto:phil@happykite.co.uk)

## SASS

A gulpfile for minifying and compiling SASS files into CSS has been provided. If you don't know how gulp works then don't feel obligated to use it, it's no problem at all but if you do then SASS away!

## WordPress

If you have experience using WordPress then you can do things the WordPress way but, again, if you don't know, it's okay.

## Assets

You can find all the images in the provided Dropbox link, this should have all the img you will need. No need to source your own assets
